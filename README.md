Containerized a full-stack MERN application using Docker, leveraging a docker-compose.yml file for multi-container orchestration.

Defined a custom Docker network in order to enable seamless inter-container communication between frontend, backend, and database services.

Created a Dockerfile for the frontend (React) application to build and serve the client-side code in a lightweight container.

Created a Dockerfile for the backend (Node.js/Express) service to handle API operations and server-side logic.

Pulled and configured an official MongoDB image from Docker Hub to serve as the database service.

Used Docker Compose to build, link, and run all services as a unified, scalable development environment.
